# 12Day-100DaysOfPythonGPT-NumberGuessing
Day 12 of the [100 Days of Code with Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) from Udemy.

## What is 100DaysOfPythonGPT?

100 Days of Python is a Python Bootcamp from Udemy that provides 100 days of Python pratical content with lessons and projects. The GPT part is something I'm adding to the course and infers that I shall use ChatGPT's engine and/or API in some way on each and every one of those 100 projects. Furthermore, I shall also practice using PyTest to test these projects and applications at least in some level.

## NumberGuessing

Number Guessing is the twelvth project of the twelvth Day of the bootcamp. Its purpose is to understand the scope of variables. It dit not make sense for me to use global variables though because I always encapsulate the main function inside of a function.

The actual project consists of a simple game of Guessing a Number with the possibility to choose easy mode with 10 attempts or hard mode with 5.

It did not seam feasible to use ChatGPT's API and testing for this project,

## Project Structure

 - [src/](src/) - There is only the file `guessing_game.py` with the game loop.
